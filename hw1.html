            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry
            produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in
            the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may
            be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The
            fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually
            elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a
            rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.
            The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost
            all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild
            species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

                <h2>Description</h2>   
          <p>
            The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant.
             All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure
            usually called a "corm". Plants are normally tall and fairly
            sturdy with a treelike appearance, but what appears to be a trunk is
            actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide
            variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 centimetres
            (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.
             Banana plants are among the fastest growing of all plants, with daily
            surface growth rates recorded from 1.4 square metres (15 sq ft) to
            1.6 square metres (17 sq ft).
            The leaves of banana plants are composed of a stalk (petiole) and a blade (lamina).
             The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make
            up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant.
             The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. 
             As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are
            forced apart.

                <h2>Nutrition</h2>
          <p>
            Raw bananas (not including the peel) are 75% water, 23%
            carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain negligible fat. A 100-gram
            reference serving supplies 89 Calories, 31% of the US recommended
            Daily Value (DV) of vitamin B6, and moderate amounts of vitamin C,
            manganese and dietary fiber, with no other micronutrients in
            significant content (see table).

        <div class="flex-container">
          <p>
            Although bananas are commonly thought to contain exceptional
            potassium content,[31][127] their actual potassium content is not
            high per typical food serving, having only 8% of the US recommended
            Daily Value for potassium (considered a low level of the DV, see
            nutrition table), and their potassium-content ranking among fruits,
            vegetables, legumes, and many other foods is relatively
            moderate.[128][129] Foods with higher potassium content than raw
            dessert bananas (326 mg per 100 g) include ground flaxseed (793 mg
            per 100 g), dry-roasted almonds (684 mg per 100 g), peanut butter
            (654 mg per 100 g), raw baby spinach (582 mg per 100 g), white
            button mushrooms (393 mg per 100 g), and whole grain oats (350 mg
            per 100 g). Raw yellow plantains contain 487 mg potassium per 100 g.
            Dehydrated dessert bananas (banana powder) contain 1490 mg potassium
            per 100 g.

        <h2>Are bananas OK to eat every day?</h2>
        <p>
        For most healthy people, bananas are a tasty, nutritious fruit. But it's best to just eat one or two a day, as too many could lead to weight gain and nutrient deficiency. Eating a balanced diet is key for optimal health. Bananas are an incredibly popular fruit — and it's no wonder why.

            <p>
                About 70% of Israel's banana crop is grown in the Northern R&D region. Banana-growing activity takes place in two growing regions – the Jordan Valley and the Western Galilee, each of which has unique growing characteristics.

                The best bananas are often said to come from tropical regions such as Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Firstly bananas are produced in tropical and in warm countries and all these countries produce different kind varieties of bananas with different taste of course.

                Between 150,000 and 170,000 tons of bananas are picked annually across plantations spanning some 6,700 acres (27,000 dunams). The majority of Israel's banana plantations are located in the north, in the Carmel region and the Jordan Valley, and there are smaller plantations in the south.        </p>

            <p> 
             Bananas are healthy, delicious, and versatile fruits. They're full of nutrients that could help prevent constipation, improve digestive and gut health, and promote recovery from intense activity. Eating one banana per day will provide: 12% of the DV for vitamin C.

            <h2>Is a banana a day too much sugar?</h2>
            <p> 
             One medium banana (about 126 grams) contains 29 grams of carbs and 112 calories. The carbs are in the form of sugar, starch, and fiber ( 3 ). A medium banana contains about 15 grams of sugar ( 3 ). Bananas do contain simple carbs, which can cause blood sugar levels to rise more than other nutrients.
